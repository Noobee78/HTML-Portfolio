<p>Hi, I'm Will Sheppard, a U.S. Army veteran who proudly served in the Special Operations community, where I developed a strong sense of discipline, teamwork, and perseverance
  After completing my military service, I pursued my MBA at Campbell University, further refining my leadership and business skills. I am now channeling my passion for creativity and problem-solving into a career in web and game development.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy video gaming, playing guitar, learning new languages, and exploring new places through travel. I'm currently immersed in several bootcamps, including the 100 Days of Python, App Breweryâ€™s Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, and personal studies in game development using Python Arcade and Pygame. These experiences fuel my passion for coding and building innovative digital experiences.</p>
